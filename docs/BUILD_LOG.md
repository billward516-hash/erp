# Build log

## 2026-10-21: S0 foundation + S1 first vertical slice

**Repository audit (before work):** the repository contained only `README.md` (`# erp`) and one commit. There was no existing code, stack, auth, integrations, migrations or tests, so the build is greenfield (D-001).

**Built**
- Migrations `0001` (tenancy, identity, RBAC, entitlements, audit chain, RLS), `0002` (documents, assets, locations, state log, parts, maintenance), `0003` (import profiles, batches, rows, external-ID crosswalk).
- Platform: tenant-scoped transactions, permission model + role templates, hashed API tokens, audit append and verify, blob storage interface (local adapter), tenant provisioning.
- Modules and HTTP API: org/employees, assets (incl. utilization), documents, maintenance, parts, imports, reporting.
- Import framework: CSV/XLSX/JSON parsers, auto-mapping, declarative mapping profiles, coercion (numbers, dates with per-column order inference, facility-time-zone timestamps), 5 targets, staging/dry-run, commit with savepoints, problems CSV, re-import idempotency.
- Reports: maintenance backlog and asset availability/utilization, rendered as JSON, CSV, print HTML and PDF.
- Sample data: generator for 5 messy Ridgeline files + 1 Northgate file, 4 saved mapping profiles, demo documents. The seed loads everything through the import pipeline, then creates documents, 30 days of state history and work orders in every lifecycle state.
- CI workflow (GitHub Actions with a PostgreSQL 16 service).

**Verified (commands actually run)**
- `npm run typecheck`: clean.
- `npm test`: **75 tests passed** across 5 files:
  - unit: utilization math, coercion, transforms, auto-mapping, parsers, CSV safety
  - security: tenant isolation incl. document download, cross-tenant writes, no-scope connections, audit immutability, facility scoping, consolidated access, read-only roles
  - maintenance: document approval/visibility/revision/immutability; full corrective work-order lifecycle with costs, separation of duties and return to service; pinned procedure versions
  - imports: dry run, partial commit, idempotent re-import, explicit mappings, Excel banners, hierarchies, duplicate/overlap detection, problems file, permissions, all bundled samples
  - API + reports: auth, scoping, error mapping, document upload/download, HTTP import flow, report consistency across formats, export permissions, empty-scope messaging
- `npm run seed` against the dev database completed. All sample imports produced the expected created/rejected counts (one intentionally bad parts row and one work order for a no-longer-registered machine are rejected with reasons).
- Started the server and exercised the asset, document search, import-suggest and report endpoints with curl. Rendered both PDFs to images and reviewed them visually (fixed header wrapping, unsupported glyphs, and blank pages from the footer).

**Brief §13.4 acceptance tests: status**

| Acceptance test | Status |
|---|---|
| Tenant A cannot read/write Tenant B data, incl. document downloads and background operations | ✅ tested |
| Facility-restricted user cannot access other facility; corporate user sees consolidated | ✅ tested |
| Asset has controlled searchable documents; users see only authorized approved versions from asset/work-order views | ✅ tested |
| Corrective WO links asset, technician, parts/labor, procedure, state changes, immutable audit | ✅ tested |
| LMS mixed learning events, assessments, qualification gating, revision → training review | ⏳ slice S2 (document-revision impact list already returned) |
| Reporting (a) consistent metrics across formats, (b) facility-restricted exports, (f) empty data messaging | ✅ tested. (c) print without clipping / (d) units + sources checked visually. (e) drill-down path provided, UI pending |

**Not done / known gaps:** web UI; production identity provider; S3 storage adapter; async jobs for very large imports; XLSX export; PM scheduling; inventory; LMS. See ROADMAP and ARCHITECTURE §8.
